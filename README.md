# ProxyLearning
The implementation of Proxy Learning presented in "S. R. Kheradpisheh, M. Mirsadeghi, T. Masquelier, Spiking neural networks trained via proxy.", availbale at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13208.

The spiking neural network  is implemented using Spikingjelly package available at https://spikingjelly.readthedocs.io/. The codes are implementded with Spikingjelly version 0.0.0.0.8.

The codes are adjusted to be run on Google colab.

The pretrained spiking neural (SNN) and its equivalent artificial neural network (ANN) are available in SNN_Params.pt and ANN_Params.pt files, respectively. You can download the pretrained model at https://www.dropbox.com/s/xhg0e2ndesqu5tj/Pretrained.zip?dl=0.
