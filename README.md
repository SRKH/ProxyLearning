# ProxyLearning
The implementation of Proxy Learning presented in "S. R. Kheradpisheh, M. Mirsadeghi, T. Masquelier, Spiking neural networks trained via proxy.", availbale at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13208.

The spiking neural network  is implemented using Spikingjelly package available at https://spikingjelly.readthedocs.io/.

The pretrained spiking neural (SNN) and its equivalent artificial neural network (ANN) are available in SNN_Params.pt and ANN_Params.pt files, respectively.
